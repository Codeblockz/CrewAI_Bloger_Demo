# Building a Simple Blog Writing Crew with CrewAI

Creating high-quality blog content efficiently is a challenge many writers face. CrewAI offers an innovative solution by leveraging AI agents to streamline the writing process. This tutorial will guide you through building a simple blog writing crew using CrewAI, ensuring you can harness the power of AI to produce engaging and well-researched blog posts.

## Step 1: Install CrewAI

Before we dive into building your blog writing crew, you need to install CrewAI. Ensure you have Python installed (compatible versions are >=3.10,<=3.13). Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
pip install crewai
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

This will install CrewAI and the necessary tools to get started.

## Step 2: Assemble Your Agents

Agents are the core components of CrewAI. Each agent has a specific role and capabilities. For a blog writing crew, we need at least two agents: a researcher and a writer. Here’s how you can define them:

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Set your API keys
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

# Define the search tool
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# Create a researcher agent
researcher = Agent(
    role='Senior Researcher',
    goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies in {topic}',
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
    backstory=(
        "Driven by curiosity, you're at the forefront of innovation, eager to explore and share knowledge that could change the world."
    ),
    tools=[search_tool],
    allow_delegation=True
)

# Create a writer agent
writer = Agent(
    role='Writer',
    goal='Narrate compelling tech stories about {topic}',
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
    backstory=(
        "With a flair for simplifying complex topics, you craft engaging narratives that captivate and educate, bringing new discoveries to light in an accessible manner."
    ),
    tools=[search_tool],
    allow_delegation=False
)
```

## Step 3: Define the Tasks

Next, we need to outline specific tasks for each agent. These tasks help guide the agents in their roles and ensure a structured workflow.

```python
from crewai import Task

# Research task
research_task = Task(
    description=(
        "Identify the next big trend in {topic}. Focus on identifying pros and cons and the overall narrative. Your final report should clearly articulate the key points, its market opportunities, and potential risks."
    ),
    expected_output='A comprehensive 3 paragraphs long report on the latest AI trends.',
    tools=[search_tool],
    agent=researcher
)

# Writing task
write_task = Task(
    description=(
        "Compose an insightful article on {topic}. Focus on the latest trends and how it's impacting the industry. This article should be easy to understand, engaging, and positive."
    ),
    expected_output='A 4 paragraph article on {topic} advancements formatted as markdown.',
    tools=[search_tool],
    agent=writer,
    async_execution=False,
    output_file='new-blog-post.md'
)
```

## Step 4: Form the Crew

With agents and tasks defined, we combine them into a crew. This crew will follow a specified workflow to accomplish the tasks.

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process

# Form the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    cache=True,
    max_rpm=100,
    share_crew=True
)
```

## Step 5: Kick It Off

Finally, initiate the process and watch your agents collaborate to produce the blog content.

```python
# Start the process
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI in healthcare'})
print(result)
```
