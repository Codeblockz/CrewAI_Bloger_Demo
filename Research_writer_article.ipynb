      "💡Part of our experiments in messing around with different frameworks!💡This was written in March, 2024 and with the current pace of progress it might have become redundant Already! ☺️In this era of generative AI, specifically Large Language Models(LLMs) and large Multi-modal Models(LMMs), Autonomous AI agents enable seamless integration of Generative AI into daily workflows with ease.What if we could harness not only one but Multiple Autonomous AI Agents, each specialized in different tasks like web browsing, database interaction, or complex calculations and specific tools like image generation, web scraping, api integration etc., all working together towards predefined goals to achieve desired results? The tasks will be executed in sequential or hierarchical Process, all the agents working like a Crew together. And one of the best frameworks for this, with additional benefit of being open-source, is CrewAI.This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CrewAI platform’s components through two CrewAI Examples walkthroughs. The first Example will introduce you to the framework, while the second will take you into advanced strategies and utilities for optimizing your crew’s performance in achieving your goals.Major components of CrewAIIn this section we will discuss all the components that forms the core of CrewAI. Agents: Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like ‘Researcher’, ‘Writer’, or ‘Customer Support’, each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.Tasks: In the CrewAI framework, tasks are individual assignments that agents complete. They encapsulate necessary information for execution, including a description, assigned agent, required tools, offering flexibility for various action complexities.Tools: A tool in CrewAI is a skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions. This includes tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools, enabling everything from simple searches to complex interactions and effective teamwork among agents.Process: In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.Crew: A crew in CrewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.Here is a visual representation of how all of them works together:Source: CrewAI Github RepositoryCrewAI Initial SetupSo, First things first. We got to do do some initial setting up in order to use CrewAI. pip install 'crewai[tools]'\n",
      "pip install duckduckgo-searchThe [tools] prefix will install some additional tools implemented inside CrewAI. Note that, we can seamlessly use these tools, as well as tools implemented in langchain with CrewAI, same as we can implement our own Tools, that we will see in a second. We have also installed duckduckgo-search , a Python API for the DuckDuckGo search engine which enhances internet browsing capabilities for our crew.In this article, we also aim to guide you on the best practices for securely managing and handling API keys. Stay tuned for valuable insights and strategies to safeguard your API keys effectively.LLM SelectionFor peak performance with your CrewAI crew, consider using GPT-4 or the slightly cheaper GPT-3.5 from OpenAI for your AI agents. These models are the backbone of your agents and significantly impact their capabilities. To use them, get an API key from OpenAI and set up essential environment variables in a .env file (which should only reside in your computer):OPENAI_API_BASE='https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions'\n",
      "OPENAI_MODEL_NAME='gpt-4-turbo-preview' # or gpt-3.5-turbo \n",
      "OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR OPENAI API KEY'Among open-source alternatives to use with CrewAI, models like Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1 can be hosted on your hardware using frameworks likeOllama . You can follow the instructions on the ReadME page to set up, and when all that is done, set up the variables:OPENAI_API_BASE='http://localhost:11434/v1'\n",
      "OPENAI_MODEL_NAME='openhermes' # Adjust based on available model\n",
      "OPENAI_API_KEY=''\n",
      "For running CrewAI with cost-effective hosted LLMs, consider services like together.ai, offering affordable options for open-source models; check their pricing and available models before configuring variables.For Services like together.ai:OPENAI_API_BASE='https://api.together.xyz'\n",

This tool will assist in planning your journey, detailing your destination, costs, and crafting a comprehensive trip itinerary based on your interests. Lets take a trip to how we create this amazing tool with CrewAI.First, we will need a SERPER api for leveraging the capabilities Google Search(we have used DuckDuckGo in the previous project, but lets learn something new). You need to just sign up, and obtain the key. Next, we introduce another awesome tool Browserless, a valuable tool that mimics a full-fledged browser environment. By using Browserless locally with Docker, you can simulate website functionalities seamlessly. If Docker isn’t installed yet, do so by following the installation instructions online as it is an essential developer tool.So, when you have docker, run this:docker run -d --rm --name browserless -p 3000:3000 browserless/chromeNow with all the tools set up, we are ready to build out trip assistant..env : File with all environmental variablesTo securely store your API keys, create a file named .env and input your keys within. Ensure the .env file remains confidential, and consider adding it to your .gitignore to prevent exposure when committing to Github. The .env file should follow this format:SERPER_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n",

For scaling needs or serverless options, browserless.io’s enterprise offering can provide a suitable solution. Simply integrate the respective API key into your .env file and use the commented URL as required.Upon receiving the response from Browserless, the content undergoes chunking, cleaning, and merging to organize the data efficiently into a unified text called content.To handle the fixed context lengths of language models, we break down the content into smaller text chunks. For each chunk, we create a chunking task and a corresponding agent to summarize it. After executing each task, we aggregate all the summaries into one single summary text, enabling us to utilize a concise summary of the entire webpage instead of its full content.We know that the LLMs often make mistakes while doing complex mathematical calculations, but they are very good at writing the equation.

In the context of tour planning, we can identify key roles crucial for a successful trip coordination.Firstly, we introduce the city_selection_expert — an agent equipped with general knowledge of popular cities to guide us in selecting the best destination based on preferences and seasonal considerations. Following this, the local_expert steps in to provide in-depth insights about the selected city, offering valuable local perspectives. Finally, the travel_concierge, a seasoned specialist in travel planning and logistics, brings decades of experience to orchestrate seamless trip arrangements.By delineating roles and responsibilities for each agent, we ensure a comprehensive and tailored approach to tour planning. The agents.py script will reflect the allocation of these roles to create a cohesive and efficient Crew for the task at hand.from crewai import Agent\n",

For our project, we will divide our main target(getting a comprehensive travel plan) into three separate tasks, identify_task , gather_task and plan_task . Here are the description of each task,identify_task : The task involves analyzing cities based on criteria like weather, events, and costs to select the best one for the trip, considering factors such as current weather, cultural events, and expenses.gather_task : As the local expert, the task is to create a detailed guide for travelers, covering attractions, customs, events, and daily activities unique to the chosen city. The guide aims to offer insights only known to locals, providing a thorough overview of the city's highlights, including hidden gems, landmarks, weather forecasts, and estimated costs.plan_task : Expanding from the guide, this task involves creating a detailed 7-day travel itinerary with daily plans. It includes weather forecasts, dining suggestions, packing tips, and a budget breakdown for a comprehensive trip plan.So, let's see now the tools.py file will contain:from crewai import Task\n",

How the publication of the blog directly to your Medium account or your very own Substack newsletter can streamline the content creation process significantly.What if the trip we planned in project-2, the Crew could take care of booking the best flights for you with MakeMyTrip or making reservation at the best hotel for you with BookMyTrip? By integrating such functionalities seamlessly, the Crew could revolutionize the travel experience by handling all aspects of the journey effortlessly.At Composio, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI-first agentic software integrations, aiming to merge these and hundreds more daily used tools seamlessly with powerful AI agents. And the most exciting part is you can used these easy integrations with your raw LLM call, with utility libraries like Langchain, or multi-agent interaction toolkit such as CrewAI or Autogen. Stay tuned for exciting developments in these transformative capabilities that promise to enhance efficiency and convenience in our daily lives.Final wordsIn this article, we covered the CrewAI platform. By following the examples, I hope you've learned essential components and tricks for creating what you need. If you have any questions or suggestions to improve the article's helpfulness, feel free to reach out. See you next time!N.B: Both the examples we have used here are taken and modified from the CrewAI examples . There are a lot more examples, and you can explore further.

      "Key Features\n",
      "Role-Based Agent Design: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.\n",
      "Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.\n",
      "Flexible Task Management: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.\n",
      "Processes Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.\n",
      "Save output as file: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.\n",
      "Parse output as Pydantic or Json: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.\n",
      "Works with Open Source Models: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring your agents' connections to models, even ones running locally!\n",
      "Examples\n",

      "Connecting Your Crew to a Model\n",
      "crewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\n",
      "Please refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring you agents' connections to models.\n",
      "How CrewAI Compares\n",
      "Autogen: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\n",
      "ChatDev: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\n",
      "CrewAI's Advantage: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen's conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI's processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "AI agent development is one of the hottest frontiers of Software innovation. As the quality of Large Language Models evolves, we will witness a surge in AI agent integration with existing software systems. With AI agents, it will be possible to accomplish tasks with voice or gesture commands instead of manually navigating through applications. But right now, agent development is in its nascent stage. We are still going through the initial phase of infrastructure, tools, and framework development, similar to the Internet of the 1990s. So, in this article, we will discuss another framework for agent development called CrewAI.\n",

      "Build a collaborative AI crew for writing content.\n",
      "Explore real-life use cases of AI agents.\n",
      "This article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\n",
      "Table of contentsWhat are AI Agents?What is CrewAI?Building a Collaborative AI CrewReal-world Use CasesFrequently Asked Questions\n",
      "What are AI Agents?\n",
      "The language models excel at translation, summarizing, and reasoning. However, you can do so much with them. One of the ways to fully realize the reasoning potential is to make LLMs agentic. The AI agents are LLMs augmented with the right tools and prompts. These agents can automate browsing, web scrapping, SQL query execution, file operations, and more. The agents use the reasoning capacity of LLMs to select a tool based on current requirements. But instead of using a single agent for a task, we can ensemble many of them to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
      "Langchain is the default tool that comes to mind when discussing AI agents. However, manually orchestrating AI agents to perform collaborative tasks would be challenging with Langchain. This is where CrewAI comes into the picture.\n",
      "What is CrewAI?\n",
      "CrewAI is an open-source framework for orchestrating role-playing and autonomous AI agents. It helps create collaborative AI agents to accomplish complex goals with ease. The framework is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, delegate tasks, and share goals, much like a real-world crew. These are some of the unique features of the CrewAI:\n",
      "Role-based Agents: We can define agents with specific roles, goals, and backstories to give more context to LLMs before answer generation.\n",
      "Task management: Define tasks with tools and dynamically assign them to agents.\n",
      "Inter-agent delegation: The agents can delegate tasks to other agents to collaborate effectively.\n",
      "Below is a representation of the CrewAI mind map.\n",
      "The CrewAI seamlessly integrates with the Langchain ecosystem. This means we can use the Langchain tools and LLM integrations with CrewAI. \n",
      "Building a Collaborative AI Crew\n",
      "To understand CrewAI better, let’s build collaborative AI agents for creative content writing. For this, we will define agents, tools, and the respective tasks for each agent. As it is a team for content writing, we will define three separate agents, like an idea analyst, a writer, and an editor. Each agent will be assigned a task.\n",
      "The analyst agent will be responsible for analyzing the idea and preparing a comprehensive blueprint for writing the content. The Writer agent will prepare the draft for the article, and finally, the editor will be responsible for formatting, editing, and correcting the draft. As we know, CrewAI lets us augment agents with custom tools. We will augment the editor with a tool to save it to the local disk. But to accomplish all these things, we need an LLM. Here, we will use Google’s Gemini model.\n",
      "Let’s delve into the coding\n",
      "As with any Python project, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies. We will need the Crewai library and Langchain’s implementation of Google GenAI. You can use other LLMs, like open-access models from Together, Any scale, or OpenAI models.\n",
      "pip install crewai langchain-google-genai\n",
      "The next step is to define our LLM and collaborative Agents. Create a separate file named agents.py to define agents.\n",

      " except Exception:\n",
      " return \"Error with the input format for the tool.\"\n",
      "The above write_file method is decorated with Langchain’s tool function. As the CrewAI uses Langchain under the hood, the tools must comply with Langchain’s conventions.

      "Autonomous AI agents can have a lot of use cases. From personal assistants to virtual instructors. Here are a few use cases of AI agents.\n",
      "Personal AI Assistant: Personal Assistants will be an integral part of us soon. A Jarvis-like assistant that processes all your data provides insight as you go and handles trivial tasks by itself.\n",
      "Code interpreters: OpenAI’s code interpreter is a brilliant example of an AI agent. The interpreter can run any Python script and output the results in response to a text prompt. This is arguably the most successful agent to date.\n",
      "Virtual Instructors: As the AI tech evolves, we can expect virtual instructors in many fields like education, training, etc.\n",
      "Agent First Software: A huge potential use case of AI agents is in agent first software development. Instead of manually browsing and clicking buttons to get things done, AI agents will automatically accomplish them based on voice commands.\n",
      "Spatial Computing: As the AR/VR tech evolves, AI agents will play a crucial role in bridging the gap between the virtual and real world.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "We are still in the early stages of AI agent development. Currently, for the best possible outcome from AI agents, we need to rely on GPT-4, and it is expensive. But as the open-source models catch up to GPT-4, we will get better options for running AI agents efficiently at a reasonable cost. On the other hand, the frameworks for agent development are progressing rapidly. As we move forward, the frameworks will enable agents to perform even more complex tasks.\n",

      "Processes Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.\n",
      "Save output as file: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.\n",
      "Parse output as Pydantic or Json: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.\n",
      "Works with Open Source Models: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring your agents' connections to models, even ones running locally!\n",

      "Connecting Your Crew to a Model\n",
      "crewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\n",
      "Please refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring you agents' connections to models.\n",
      "How CrewAI Compares\n",
      "Autogen: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\n",
      "ChatDev: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\n",
      "CrewAI's Advantage: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen's conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI's processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.\n",
